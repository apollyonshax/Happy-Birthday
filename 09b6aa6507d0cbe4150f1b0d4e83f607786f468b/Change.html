    <h2> Changes </h2>

    <div class="content">

            The irony of reality is that the only thing constant in this world is change. It’s a tale as old as time itself that everything that begins, must come to an end. To do that, it must go through substantial change. So when we know that this world is made to experience change, then ask yourself, why do you waste time precious time you have fearing or even fighting the inevitable?<br/><br />
            Every year, every month, every day, every hour, every minute, every second and every tiny moment, we experience change. Realize that if not for change, you and I would never have met. If not for change, we’d never have fallen in love even if we had met at birth. If not for change, I would not have learned from my past and you would have never from yours. If not for change, your parents would never have experience the blessing of loving your child the way they love you.<br /><br />
            Sure, the concept of change can be scary because with it comes the concept of loss, but not everything lost is bad. Sometimes you lose the worst parts of you. Sometimes you change in a way that may not be better for others but is for you in the long run. That is why we are expected to trust and believe in God’s plan for only God knows what benefits every tiny speck of change brings our way.<br /><br />
            Change isn’t a bad thing but it can be scary if you’re not ready for it. So don’t fear change, just take control over it and learn to adapt to it. It’s the same concept I preached to you months ago, when you’re at 10%, I’ll give you the other 90. When you change, I’ll adapt. Because one thing that will never change is how I feel for you. Because the only constant change towards that feeling is how is grows every moment that I know you and how I love you more and more. So no matter how you may change in the future, I’m confident I’ll adapt because you’re worth the journey.<br />
