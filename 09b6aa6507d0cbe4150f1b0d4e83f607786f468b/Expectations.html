    <h2> Breaking Expectations </h2>

    <div class="content">
        <p>
            This is the one I take issue with. You say you’re afraid of breaking someone’s expectation, albeit someone close to your heart, I feel this insecurity has a fundamental flaw. You’re looking at “expectations” from a skin deep point of view and that is why it messes with you. See if you try to live your life on someone else’s ideologies, thinking and dreams, on the basis of what they think is best decision for you, you’ll end up failing at life. Here’s the thing, whatever that someone thinks is the right move, it might be for them, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it is the right one for you. It’s the same concept of never follow in someone’s else’s path, always carve your own. You and whoever expects from you are built different. That variable alone is far too great for you to be living your life according to someone else and at the end of the day, you will be unhappy.<br /><br />
            In expectations, there are end goals. Like parents want their kids to be successful so they want them to become doctors and engineers because according to them, that’s the road to success. But maybe you’re not built for that and following those things will only leave you to failure or at best a life of mediocrity. My love, settling for second best was never an option. In this life, in this one chance you got, you give it your all and not an ounce less because you don’t owe any mortal your life. Keeping the obvious aside that you do owe your life to a Supreme Deity and must oblige to His commands, you are not obligated to do everything anyone else says down to the letter. The thing is, look at big picture. Fulfill the reason behind the expectations, not the expectation itself. For example, you need to make your parents proud by being successful, happy and pious. See, how you achieve those three things is not necessarily penned down or set in stone. They may have a different roadmap to those destinations which might not work out so well for you. So take your own path. Do it your own way.<br /><br />
            It’s kind of like coding. There are a lot of ways to do it and if you don’t do it your way, you won’t understand shit and you’ll prolly mess up a lot of other things related to it. So whether it be me, your parents or anyone for that matter, you’re not supposed to be meet every expectation at face value. You can never make the whole world happy, I want you to remember that. This is your life, your freedom and your choice. Do it your way, Duaa. I know whatever you choose, you’ll do the right thing. I trust you. So make me proud by making yourself proud. Aim for your happiness and everyone that loves you will be proud of you, regardless of how rough the road.<br /><br />
            The only expectations you need to meet are your own.<br/>
