    <h2> Loss </h2>

    <div class="content">
        <p>
            This one stands on two fronts. First being losing someone in emotion or presence in your life and the second one being of death. First I’ll talk about the people you lose in your life. I’m no stranger to this one and I’ve learned a lot from it. I’m not gonna sit here and lie saying losing people won’t be one of the worst things you will ever feel. However, that doesn’t mean that it needs to make or break you. See, the first thing you need to understand is the thing I understood when it was too late. The first thing you need to do in life is be okay with just being by yourself; by being all alone. Love yourself and pick yourself up enough that you don’t mind your own company. Once you accomplish that, you’ll never feel the need to run after anyone else. You’ll always think you’re enough. This one directly correlates with worth.<br/><br />
            When someone comes into your life, when God places them in your path, they’re merely to become a part of a certain part of your life. The perfect analogy is and always has been that they’re merely a certain chapter in the book of life. No one stays forever, that’s how the world was designed and there’s a reason for that and a good one at that. Everyone, no matter how insignificant their presence seems, has a part to play in your life and have a purpose for being in your life. But the thing is, to allow others to play their given part in your life, fate has to take out the extra baggage and so people leave. Understanding this concept of fate is imperative to understand that it’s not because of you that they left. It’s just how it is. People come to teach us something and after that they leave. Yes, it hurts but that’s just because even when people leave, they leave behind the memories, the feelings and the lessons. And at the end, when you’ve written the final letter in your book, you’ll realize that it’s filled with all the memories of all the people who came, whether they left or stayed.<br /><br />
            What I’m trying to say is, if you keep holding on to the past, you will never be able to relish in the glorious things the future has in store for you. You’ll live life stuck in the same chapter and will never be able to live through the book. The words will merely go over you as you cling on to the same chapter and because of that you will miss out on so much more. Due to that, when people come into your life, welcome them with open arms for God sent you with new vessels and entities to play their part. When they leave, hold no regrets, hate or any negative feelings. Be glad they came in the first place and cherish all that they gave you. The memories, the lessons and the feelings, they will serve you well for the future and they will shape you to be the best you that you can possibly be. So never hold on to the past. Always strive towards the future.<br /><br />
            The second part of loss comes in death and a part of that is what I’ve already talked about. But when it’s about death, it’s not that easy to do. So here comes the concept of 2 things. The first is faith. Have enough faith to know that they are at a better place. Understand that your time on earth is merely a waiting period until you can go back to them and one day soon you’ll meet them again. The entire point of loss is to test how we act during such great pain and how grateful we still remain to Allah. So don’t ever lose yourself no matter who you end up losing. Remember this life is merely temporary and it will end and so, your time alone is also temporary. It’s the time given to you in order to make an effort for the one’s you lose, to touch more lives and to make an effort for your own soul. So never stop fighting, Duaa. For the one’s you lose, pray for their soul. For the one’s that remain in your life, never take them for granted. For yourself, have faith that Allah will always be there for you.<br /><br />
            The second part is something I’ve said a lot and will again. The second part is collateral beauty. See I believe that when a person dies, their loss is unshakably painful and there’s a reason for that. The way when a baby cries, you can’t ignore it, because the frequency was designed to be something that would make it un-ignorable so that we’d cater to it. The same concept applies to the pain of loss. Without it, we’d never comprehend how valuable human life is especially some specific people. To me, it’s how people live on through others; it’s how legacy works. It’s how the torch is passed on from one person to another. When you feel that pain, you remember why it hurts so much and all those memories are something you hold close to you. They’re so dear to you that they shape you, motivate you and are something  you start to live in accordance to. You literally inherit the will of the person you love and through you they live on. Which is why if I ever lose you, I would never want that pain to fade. I’d live my entire life with an agonizing scar than to risk losing what you mean to me. Than to forget this feeling of love and care that I feel for you. If pain is the cost I must pay to truly keep you within me, then I pay it gladly.<br /><br />
