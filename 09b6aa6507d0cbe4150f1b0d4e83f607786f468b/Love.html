    <h2> Forbidden Love? </h2>

    <div class="content">
        <p>
            The one that has me stumped too xD Our religion allows us to love but our society doesn’t. Here’s my take on this. The way I’ve lived my life, after being thrashed by external family and friends alike, is realizing that family isn’t about who you’re related to. The phrase was never blood is thicker than water; it was “The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb.” I believe that family is where our heart is at. Home is where love is at. Otherwise, it’s merely a house surrounded by fences. See, Duaa, people may say some flashy words and do things to make you feel you owe them but you need to realize that you owe no one your life but you. We all come here in this world to help each other. No one is self-sufficient. We were made this way to see how we act when we’re put into a world where we have to be co-dependent. People who give and people who take both are being tested. This is fate. Predestination. Destiny. You don’t owe anyone your life just because they managed to follow the way the world was designed to be. They will be rewarded surely if they help you with pure intentions. Having said that, I’m not saying you should be ungrateful, no. But there’s such a thing as being too grateful. Don’t be that either. Anything extreme is bad. Just because your family is kind and helped you doesn’t mean you owe them the rest of your life. You are not anyone’s property or possession and in this codependent world, you need to realize your individuality. You have to decide for your own heart, your own future, your own life and your own kids. If you don’t Duaa, you’re not only wronging yourself but also allowing more generations to be tortured the same way.<br /><br />
            Our religion allows us to love and so if we do it the right way, I don’t believe anyone has the right to dictate our hearts or future. If you still feel indebted, we’ll start returning all the debts you feel you have gradually after marriage so you feel lighter. But all in all, Duaa, if you truly do love me as I love you, please don’t let the feeling of guilt let us die. Please.<br /><br />
            I will fight armies just to get to you and make you mine. All I ask is that in return you never stop choosing me. I love you, Duaa. Never doubt that and never be afraid to follow your heart. Despite having mine broken twice before, I can testify it’s a fight worth fighting for. You are worth dying for. Please, never give up on me or your heart. And I will never stop fighting for as long as there is breath in my lungs. I love you, Forever and Always.<br /><br />
