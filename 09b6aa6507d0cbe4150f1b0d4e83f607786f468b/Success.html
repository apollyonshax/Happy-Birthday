    <h2> Success </h2>

            As I write this, I feel I’m reiterating the same concept over and over but that is the bases of my belief system so yeah. When one looks at success, they think money, position, power. However, that is a very skin deep outlook of success. Seeing people of all ages and experiences, I feel that as you grow up, you start measuring success by how memorable and special the moments in your life were. See, what is owed to you, it will be yours. What you’re fated to achieve, that will get to you. However, the question is, throughout the course of fate, were you happy? Were the decisions you made in your life decisions that you can be proud of? Can you stand up at the end of the day with a smile on your face and proclaim that you lived life you way?<br /><br />
            Because, sweetheart, at the end of the day it won’t matter what amount you had in your bank account or what position you hold at which firm. What will matter is how many hearts you touched, how many lives you changed and how many faces did you put smiles on. If you ever want to be successful, all you need to do is be true to who you are and never give up. Never stop believing in yourself because as long as you have belief, success is merely just a matter of when not if.<br /><br />
            I believe in you. Your capacity. Your capability. In who you are. There’s no doubt in my mind that you will one day achieve success as long as you don’t give up on it. The real question is, by the end of it all, will you be happy? Because trust me Duaa, that is all that will matter when it’s all said and done.<br /><br />
            Success is the way you perceive your actions, efforts and intentions. So, tbh, to me you already are successful and having you in my life at the position I am in, I feel like I am successful too.<br/>
