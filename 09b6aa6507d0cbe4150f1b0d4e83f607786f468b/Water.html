    <h2> Aquaphobia </h2>

    <div class="content">
        <p>
            I never figured you for a Aquaphobe, but I’ve been thinking about it ever since you told me about it. It’s not that you’re afraid of water but just large bodies of water which means you’re afraid of either what’s underneath or of drowning. See, the way I see it, both those things directly relate to not having control because when you’re under water, you’re not free to maneuver the way you’d want to. The loss of control and fear of the unknown overtake you because that’s what water represents for you. But the reason my mind couldn’t grasp you being a aquaphobe at first is because, to me, water represent purity, grace, healing and to some extent life. In my eyes, that’s exactly what you represent. To me, you’re the water to my fire. <br /><br />
            Water doesn’t always have to be bad either. Imagine all the different forms that water takes and how soothing it is. Like the sound the water makes when it hits the rocks on a clear running river. Or the beauty of a waterfall. Imagine the rain pouring down on you, the soothing earthly smell and for a moment how the whole world changes. How the skies turn a beautiful color of grey and sometimes the thunder that roars into your very soul. Water can be beautiful. <br /><br />
            However, I can relate to the fear of the unknown and loss of control. How there could be anything down there and even if there wasn’t, I would just sink down into the cool icy ocean. But even though a part of me fears it, another part of me wonders what could be down there. With different kinds of sea-life, to the mere glory of a whale, the sea has so much that we’ve never known. Imagine not knowing all that resides in 70% of earth alone. Some could be cute and friendly like dolphins while others could be dangerous but interesting like a shark. Don’t you ever just wonder what if there’s something bigger than a whale under the deep blue sea but just too shy to come out? Imagine something that big being afraid. I mean, fear comes in all shapes and sizes, even the strongest of us are afraid. But even so, imagine all we could do if we just looked past that fear. The heights we could reach. The knowledge we could attain. The potential beauty we can see and friends we could make. If we just chose to control our own emotions, own fears, imagine how limitless the world is.<br /><br />
            You could learn how to swim and start from a pool. Maneuver in water as if it was your home ground – your turf. I mean you already look like a beautiful mermaid, might as well move like one too, right? You can learn of marine life and could realize how friendly it is. I mean think about it, if you know what to do right, you could even tame a lion. Imagine the heights you could reach – one day maybe even swim in the deep blue ocean itself. The world is limitless, but so are you, Duaa. All it takes is a choice. In this life, there are something’s we can control and some we can’t. Do what you can to the best of what you’ve got and leave the rest up to faith. The water, pure, vast and full of life was made for us. Own it.<br /><br />
