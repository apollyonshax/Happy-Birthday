            Dear Duaa, <br /><br /><br />
            There’s a month to your birthday and I don’t want anything left to last minute so I write this now because I feel whatever I am to say, my feelings and my thoughts, they will never change. So here it goes. You came into my life like a little firefly shining its light in a world full of darkness. At first, I was weary of you; unsure. However, little by little I started to understand you. Little by little, I started to see the real you. You’re a healer, a kind soul with the heart of a warrior. But all that are things anyone can see in you tbh. So here’s my personal perspective of Sayyeda Duaa Aslam.<br /><br />
            I don’t trust anyone and I never thought I would be able to. My longest and greatest allies have been my pain, my paranoia and my instinct. They’ve never lied to me once and every time I’ve ignored them, bad things happened to me. That made me an insecure person by nature and it was hard to believe people much less trust them even in relations that required those two things just to exist. Here’s the kicker, though. You are the only person I’ve never doubted. It’s not to say that I’m going against my instincts, pain or paranoia, no; I don’t even feel that’s possible at this point. Interestingly enough, I’m starting to think that they have started to go with you. For the first time in my life, I think my instinct doesn’t heed me caution but instead it tells me to run towards you; to believe in you. For some reason, all of the things that told me to run away as fast as I could are now telling me to run just as swiftly towards you. At first I thought I was going against my nature but now I realize I’m not doing that. I realize, the reason I’m not insecure this time is that even the worst of me sees the best in you and with all my heart, all my soul and with every fiber of my being, I trust you Duaa.<br /><br />
            This trust in you has granted me something I thought could only be achieved through all-out war; peace. You gave me peace without having to lift a finger and you have left me awe-struck. I’m paralyzed, shook to my core, at how good, how pure, how extraordinary you make me feel. You make me feel like I’m the only one in the world and every time I feel I’m not enough, your presence, actions and words guide me back from out of the depths of my despair. My rock, my anchor, my guiding light; you make me feel like I’m invincible. When I’m with you, it’s almost as if I’ve been compelled by the supernatural to spill all my secrets to you and place my hearts in your hands to trust, to hold and to keep. You make me feel as if I can do no wrong and that makes me want to try even harder to do right so I never lose that perspective in your eyes.<br /><br />
            You are my north star, the best part of me and I could never bear your loss. I’ve done much wrong in my life and I’ve regretted a lot. So as I sit here, the only desire I feel is that I don’t have anything to regret when it comes to you. I wish to make you happy, no matter what that entails or what it costs. Duaa, my desire is that I never take you for granted not even for a moment. I feel like all those mistakes I made in the past, all I’ve been through and everything I’ve ever lost has brought me to this moment in my life because I know that no matter what, I cannot afford to screw this up. Due to that, I feel everything I’ve ever suffered has been worth it because if any ounce of pain can ever teach me the lesson I need to always have a way to keep you happy, then I will suffer pains equivalent to the droplets of waters in all the oceans on all the planets combined. In my heart, I know that whatever it takes to achieve my goal will be worth it because Duaa, you are worth it. Every ounce of blood, every drop of sweat and every surge or emotion, you are worth it. So even if a time comes where I have to go through the impossible and live through your loss, no matter for what reason that might be, I will always hold on tight to your words, your memories, your worth, your lessons, your dreams, your beliefs, your passion and all in all your entire being. If I have to suffer through worlds of pain just to save you from the same fate them I will go through it every single time. So if you’re ever gone, just know if you’re alive you’ll never be alone because you will always have me and will always have a place, the most important place, in my heart and if I lose you to death, please to my heart will love you with every beat, my eyes will miss you with every tear and my being will fight for you at every moment with all it’s might because I will never let you down. You, even after death, will live through me. You are my legacy as I am yours.<br /><br />
            You set your belief in me and I will work till the end of days to make good on them. Thank you. For existing; for coming into my life and for every moment you have spent with me since you did. I have cherished every moment we’ve had and I will continue to do so for the rest of my days. Whether we’re together or not, I will always be by your side and will always be yours. I’m grateful, for your time, your trust and the faith you have in me. Thank you, Duaa. For everything that you’ve done, everything that you are and every moment that you’ve given me. I just want you to know that no matter what happens two thing will always remain true till the end of days. 1) I will never leave you. And 2) I will always love you. Deeper than the skies and the oceans. More than the stars in every night sky combined. Longer than the days and the nights. I will love you, in this world and the next, for as long as I exist. You are everything to me.<br /><br />
            So Happy Birthday, my dream, my harmony, my peace. Today is truly a day of celebration. Whether history remembers it or not, this day will always be an important one in the book of  my life and the story of my legacy. I love you.<br />
            <br /><br />
            Forever Yours,<br />
            Musa.
