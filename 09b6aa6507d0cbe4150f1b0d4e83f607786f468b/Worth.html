    <h2> Your Worth </h2>

    <div class="content">
        <p>
            You feel you’re always being given too much or people around you keep going out of their way but never consider a simple truth of this world. Since the start of time people have given more than they have for what matters to them. Whether money, children, lover, parents or whatever. People always spend time, money and effort on what they deem is worth the spend. You, Duaa, are worth every dime, every moment and every ounce of sweat. In my heart, there is no greater goal, no greater motivation and no greater reward than to see you happy and be the cause of it. Your worth can not be compared by materialistic standards. There’s not enough riches in this world to match your worth in my eyes so trust me anything I do pales in comparison to how much you mean to me. So please stop worrying about how much is being done for you. Realize that you are the only reason I’d ever do anything to begin with because you are my only motivation. My only goal. My lifeline. You are everything to me and my only regret ever would be if I didn’t do enough for you. Not the other way around. Stay or leave, everything I am and everything I have are yours forever. Because are worth more than every possession combined multiplied a thousand fold. You are my necessity, Duaa Aslam.
