    <h2> My North Star </h2>

    <div class="content">
        <p>
            One starlit night, the moon’s collide <br />
            There’s a fire in the sky, like a blazing tide<br />
            Can’t see but I must, it’s a matter of pride<br />
            Thought I’d witness the apocalypse, so why do I see my bride?<br />
            <br />
            I look up towards the heavens at that blinding light<br />
            Try as I may, I could never even dream up such a sight<br />
            The creation of God, an unattainable height<br />
            Still, how can a mere mortal shine that bright?<br />
            <br />
            I realize it’s not her but me that God blessed<br />
            Made me able to love unconditionally, no feeling repressed<br />
            It isn’t blasphemy, just feelings that I confess<br />
            She may not be divinity, but she is celeste<br />
            <br />
            As I gaze upon that star, I do wonder if she’ll be mine<br />
            At times I’m sure, at times I need a sign<br />
            I guess it doesn’t matter if our fate is tied with ropes or twine<br />
            If at the end she’s happy, I’m sure I’ll be fine<br />
            <br />
            But let me dream just one more night of her warm embrace<br />
            Let me cherish these feelings, these memories, her face<br />
            I hope we end up together as lovers but if that is not the case<br />
            Then just know I’ll love you forever, and Happy Birthday, my grace<br />

            <br />
