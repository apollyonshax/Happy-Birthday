            <h3> Lyrics </h3>

            <p>
                Light shines bright, in my darkest nights<br />
                There I see you alive, in cold dead ice<br />
                I give my warmth to you, but do you want me to?<br />
                Do you feel about me, like I feel about you?<br /><br />

                I just don’t want to lose you<br />
                I just don’t want to bruise you<br /><br />

                So bless me, oh harmony<br />
                Take me back to when I was 3<br />
                And please see what you mean to me<br />
                You make me feel that sense of peace<br /><br />

                My heart, my soul, my every goal<br />
                You’re one truth, I can’t ignore<br /><br />

                So, in my eyes, we'll never fall apart<br />
                cuz with you I can never part<br />
                The sun shines bright<br />
                Brightest in the darkest of nights<br />
                But when i see your light<br />
                It’s as if world's collide<br />
                And the universe ignites<br />
                And yet, you’re still in the spotlight x3<br /><br />

                When hate ignites, my love will thrive<br />
                Because of you ill fight till the end of times<br />
                I put my faith in you, but would you want me to?<br />
                Do you dream about me, as I dream about you?<br /><br />

                I just want to be with you<br />
                Live the future I foresee with you<br /><br />
                So test me, oh harmony<br />
                Give me a chance, to set you free<br />
                I’ll do it right, when I take a knee<br />
                I’ll be your king, if you’ll be my queen<br />
                <br />
                My light, the sight that clears the dark of nights<br />
                In my heart, you’ll be immortalized<br /><br />

                In my eyes, we'll never fall apart<br />
                cuz with you I can never part<br />
                The moon, it’s full tonight<br />
                I'm howling, crying for the love of my life<br />
                And when i see your eyes<br />
                The sparks they fly<br />
                And my heart it cries<br />
                Even when the world ignites<br />
                I swear it ain't no lie<br />
                That you'll still be in the spotlight x3<br /><br />

                So give me a reason<br />
                It’s so cold, you’re freezin’<br />
                But just wait for November<br />
                I’ll turn up the heat, I’m ember<br /><br />

                You’ll see the truth in who I am<br />
                I guarantee I will be your man<br /><br />



                In my eyes, we'll never fall apart<br />
                cuz with you I can never part<br />
                A body full of scars<br />
                I give you my broken heart and memoirs<br />
                So would you stay this time?<br />
                Would you be mine?<br />
                Or will you feel confined?<br />
                Whatever you decide<br />
                To it I’ll abide<br />
                And I’ll say with pride<br />
                I’ve only ever felt love inside<br />
                And even if I am denied<br />
                I don’t regret that I confide<br />
                The journey was worth the ride<br />
                And you’ll still be in the spotlight<br /><br />
