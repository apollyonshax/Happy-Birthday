    <h2> Breaking Trust </h2>

    <div class="content">
        <p>
            This one I find funny. You say you’re afraid of breaking someone’s trust and I truly do understand that but tbh that sounds like someone saying they’re afraid they’ll fall off the edge of the earth or start floating cuz gravity would suddenly fail them. See, Duaa, it’s in your nature to be honest, to be real, and to be who you are. Like it or not, you can’t change that. There’s a reason you’re the first woman I’ve ever been able to trust and that’s because you earn that trust by being nothing more than just you. You don’t have to give it any more effort than that ever. Just be you because in your heart, in your soul and in your core, that is who you are; someone who can be trusted. I’ve put my heart, my soul and my future in your hands and there is neither doubt nor fear in me because you are just that trustworthy.<br /><br />
            Sometimes I think you couldn’t even break someone’s trust even if you wanted to because you’re just built different man. You are the epitome of trust and by God, without a shadow of a doubt, I trust you completely. Now and Forever.<br/>
